# yet-another-6502-emulator

Yet another emulator for the venerable MOS 6502 to add to the ever growing list of probably better coded versions.

This will serve as a way for me to get better at coding.

My ultimate goal is to have it writing to a software terminal, hopefully run by SDL.

NOTE: the included compiler is not made by me, and so doesn't natively include the illegal opcodes.
You will need to compile with them enabled, and manually write bytecode that accesses them.

Sorry.
